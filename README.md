# Finding Donors

![volunteer](/images/volunteer.png)

## Intro
This project is for a Kaggle Competition [here](https://www.kaggle.com/c/udacity-mlcharity-competition).

## Project Overview
In this project, I need to apply supervised learning techniques and an analytical mind on data collected for the U.S. census to help CharityML (a fictitious charity organization) identify people most likely to donate to their cause.

## Data
Full description of the dataset is available [here](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/adult/adult.names).

- **census.csv** - data for training
- **test_census.csv** - test data for competition results evaluation
- **example_submission.csv** - test results submission format
