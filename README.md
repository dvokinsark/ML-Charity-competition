# Finding Donors

![volunteer](/images/volunteer.png)

## Intro
This project is for a Kaggle Competition [here](https://www.kaggle.com/c/udacity-mlcharity-competition).

## Project Overview
In this project, based on data collected for the U.S. census, I'm going to help CharityML identify people most likely to donate to their cause.

## Data
Full description of the dataset is available [here](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/adult/adult.names).

- **census.csv** - data for training
- **test_census.csv** - test data for competition results evaluation
